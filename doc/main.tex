\begin{abstract}
    This project aims to develop control or estimator with deep neural network and contraction theory.
    Learning-based control methods have been widely studied as remarkable advancements in the deep learning field.
    However, naive application of deep learning to control problems often leads to poor performance and instability.
    Even though some literature has shown that the learning-based control methods have been successfully applied to various control problems, the theoretical analysis of the stability and performance in the control perspective is still lacking.
    Moreover, recent deep learning studies begins from the stochastic optimization algorithms, which make the analysis of the stability and performance more difficult.
    To overcome theses difficulties, the contraction theory is studied to analyze its capability to analysis the stability and performance of the learning-based control methods.
